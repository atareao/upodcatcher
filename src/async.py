  Starts a new thread that calls f and schedules on_done to be run (on the main
  thread) when GTK is not busy.

  Args:
    f (function): the function to call asynchronously. No arguments are passed
                  to it. f should not use any resources used by the main thread,
                  at least not without locking.

    on_done (function): the function that is called when f completes. It is
                        passed f's result as the first argument and whatever
                        was thrown (if anything) as the second. on_done is
                        called on the main thread, so it can access resources
                        on the main thread.

  Returns:
    Nothing.

  Raises:
    Nothing.
